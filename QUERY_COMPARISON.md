# Vector Search vs Knowledge Graph: Query Comparison

**Dataset**: Medici Founder Agreements (3 founders: Shariq Ali, Aamina Bawany, Eliot Puplett)

## Executive Summary

This document demonstrates when to use **Vector/Semantic Search** vs **Knowledge Graph** queries using real Medici founder agreement data. Both approaches are complementary:

- **Vector Search**: Best for semantic similarity, conceptual understanding, and natural language queries
- **Knowledge Graph**: Best for relationships, comparisons, multi-hop reasoning, and structured analysis

**Key Insight**: The most powerful system uses BOTH approaches together (hybrid retrieval).

2. **"Compare the repurchase rights across all founders"**
   - Graph: Identify all founders and their agreements
   - Vector: Retrieve semantically similar repurchase clauses
   - Result: Comparative analysis with exact text

3. **"Show me founders who joined after 2024 and their responsibilities"**
   - Graph: Filter by date (October 2025) and get founder list
   - Vector: Semantic search for "responsibilities" ‚Üí "Provided Services"
   - Result: Filtered list with relevant context

4. **"What legal terms affect all three founders?"**
   - Graph: Find legal terms connected to all 3 entities

## üìä When to Use Which Approach

### Use Vector Search When:
- ‚úÖ Questions are in natural language
- ‚úÖ You need semantic understanding (not just keywords)
- ‚úÖ Looking for similar concepts across documents
- ‚úÖ User doesn't know exact terminology
- ‚úÖ Exploratory research ("tell me about...")
- ‚úÖ Summarization tasks

### Use Knowledge Graph When:
- ‚úÖ You need exact counts, sums, or aggregations
- ‚úÖ Comparing entities or attributes
- ‚úÖ Multi-hop reasoning (A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C)
- ‚úÖ Relationship-based queries ("who works at...")
- ‚úÖ Structural or hierarchical questions
- ‚úÖ Time-based filtering or calculations
- ‚úÖ Building visualizations or networks

### Use Hybrid (Both) When:
- ‚úÖ Complex analytical questions
- ‚úÖ Need both structure AND context
- ‚úÖ Comparative analysis with details
- ‚úÖ Aggregations with explanations
- ‚úÖ Production RAG systems (always!)

## üéØ Conclusion

**Vector Search** and **Knowledge Graphs** are complementary technologies:

- **Vector Search** = Understanding **meaning** and **context**
- **Knowledge Graph** = Understanding **relationships** and **structure**

**Best Practice**: Use both in a hybrid architecture:
1. Knowledge Graph for entity extraction, relationship mapping, and structured queries
2. Vector Search for semantic retrieval and contextual understanding
3. Combine results for comprehensive question answering

The Medici founder agreements demonstrate this perfectly - questions about concepts and clauses benefit from vector search, while questions about comparisons and relationships benefit from the knowledge graph.
