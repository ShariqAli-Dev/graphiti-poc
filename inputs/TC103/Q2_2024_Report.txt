Budget utilization for Q2: 92%

The budget increase reflects our expanded team and the launch of Project Phoenix. Sarah Chen secured additional funding from the Board to support both Phoenix and Atlas initiatives.

CHALLENGES AND RISKS

- Scaling Challenges: Rapid team growth requires strong onboarding processes
- Project Atlas Timeline: Aggressive Q4 launch target
- Marcus Rodriguez's transition: New VP still ramping up (minimal risk, progressing well)
- Technical Debt: Need to balance new projects with maintenance

LOOKING AHEAD TO Q3 2024

Under Sarah Chen's leadership as CTO, the Engineering Division's priorities for Q3 include:

1. Expand Project Phoenix to 75% of production traffic
2. Begin Project Atlas development phase
3. Maintain current team size at 22 engineers (no additional hiring planned)
4. Achieve full 40% cost reduction target for Phoenix
5. Continue leadership development for Marcus Rodriguez

Sarah Chen's promotion has energized the organization, and Marcus Rodriguez has proven to be an excellent VP of Engineering in his first month.
